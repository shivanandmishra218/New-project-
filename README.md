## Architecture & Implementation Details

### Architecture Pattern

The application follows a hybrid full-stack architecture using Next.js:

- Server Components for efficient data fetching and rendering  
- Client Components for interactive UI  
- Server Actions to handle backend logic securely  

This reduces API overhead and improves performance.

---

### Event-Driven Workflow (Inngest)

The system uses an event-driven model instead of polling:

- Stock updates trigger background workflows  
- Alerts are processed asynchronously  
- Built-in retry and failure handling  

Benefits:
- Low latency  
- Better scalability  
- Efficient resource usage  

---

### Data Flow

1. User interacts with UI (search, watchlist, alerts)  
2. Requests handled via Server Actions or API routes  
3. Data fetched from Finnhub API  
4. Stored in MongoDB  
5. Events triggered via Inngest  
6. AI summaries generated using Gemini  
7. Notifications sent via Nodemailer  

---

### Database Design (MongoDB)

Document-based schema:

- users → authentication and preferences  
- watchlists → tracked stocks  
- alerts → trigger conditions  
- stocks → cached data  
- notifications → alert history  

Design considerations:
- Indexed queries for performance  
- Flexible schema for scalability  
- Separation of concerns  

---

### Authentication & Security

- Implemented using Better Auth  
- Secure session handling  
- Protected server-side operations  
- Environment-based configuration  

---

### AI Integration (Gemini API)

AI enhances financial data:

- Generates summaries  
- Analyzes earnings  
- Provides sentiment insights  

Pipeline:  
Raw data → AI processing → structured insights → UI  

---

### Performance Optimizations

- Server-side rendering (SSR)  
- Optimized data fetching  
- API response caching  
- Efficient database queries  
- Lazy loading  

---

### Error Handling & Reliability

- Centralized error handling  
- Retry mechanisms in workflows  
- Graceful UI fallbacks  
- Logging for debugging  

---

### Scalability Considerations

- Stateless backend design  
- Event-driven processing  
- Modular architecture  
- Decoupled services  

---

### Code Quality & Maintainability

- TypeScript for type safety  
- Reusable components  
- Separation of concerns  
- Clean project structure
